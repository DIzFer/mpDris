# The ip-address that MPD runs on
# While this can be a different machine than your own, this is very unlikely,
# so in almost every case you can just leave it as the default value
#
# addr = "127.0.0.1"

# The TCP port that MPD listens on for its API, configured in mpd.conf or 6600
#
# port = 6600

# The amount of times to retry to get a connection to MPD before exiting
#
# retries = 3

# The root directory where your music is stored, configured in mpd.conf
# It is very likely that this is just ~/Music
# Note: while there is shell escaping, the brace syntax (${varname}) is as of v.1.2.0 not supported
#
# mpDris will search this directory for covers like this:
# - $music_directory/covers/$song_path/$filename.$ext
# - $music_directory/$song_path/$filename.$ext
# - $music_directory/$song_path/cover.$ext
#
# $ext can be one of the following values: jpg, jpeg, png, webp, avif, jxl, bmp, gif, heif, heic
# For more detail on covers, please read the Configuration section of the README
#
# music_directory = "~/Music"
